**Welcome to pRPC!**

pRPC is an open source `solid-start` utility library to make working with `server$` easier. We plan on branching out to support `bling` in the future!

### About

Write simple and interactive SolidStart code that will run on the server and is easily used on the client - with a fully typesafe API!

[Get started!](/en/install)
